# SWOT Analysis Generator

Creates a structured SWOT analysis with strategic implications using the TOWS matrix.

## Output
Save to `strategy/outputs/swot-[topic]-[YYYY-MM-DD].md`

## When to Use This Skill
- Strategic planning
- Competitive response
- New market entry
- Annual planning
- Major product decisions

## The Problem

Most SWOT analyses are brainstorm dumps — long lists in four boxes with no prioritization or strategic implications. They get created, presented once, and forgotten.

## What You'll Need
- Company/product context
- Focus area (what decision or question this SWOT informs)
- Recent developments (market changes, competitor moves)

## What You'll Get

- Prioritized SWOT matrix (top 3 in each quadrant)
- Evidence for each item
- TOWS strategic actions (SO, WO, ST, WT strategies)
- Prioritized action plan with owners
- Risk and opportunity assessment

## Process

### Step 1: Check Your Context
First, read the user's context files to gather intelligence:
- `context/company.md` — Strategic priorities, strengths, business model
- `context/product.md` — Product strengths/weaknesses, metrics, known issues
- `context/competitors.md` — Competitive threats and opportunities
- `context/personas.md` — Customer insights that reveal opportunities

**Tell the user what you found.** For example:
> "I pulled context from your files:
> - Strengths: AI capabilities, agency-specific features (from company.md)
> - Weaknesses: 'Reporting is too basic' is a known issue (product.md)
> - Threats: Monday.com brand recognition, Float's resource planning (competitors.md)
> - Opportunities: Agency vertical is underserved (company.md strategy)
>
> I'll build the SWOT around this. What's the specific focus or decision this SWOT should inform?"

### Step 2: Define Focus Area
Clarify what this SWOT is for:
> "A SWOT is most useful when it's focused. What decision or question should this inform?
> - Product decision?
> - Market entry?
> - Annual strategy?
> - Competitive response?"

### Step 3: Identify Internal Factors (Strengths/Weaknesses)
Analyze what you control — pull from context files:
- **Strengths:** Competitive advantages, resources, capabilities
- **Weaknesses:** Gaps, limitations, areas of underperformance

### Step 4: Identify External Factors (Opportunities/Threats)
Analyze what you don't control — pull from context files:
- **Opportunities:** Market trends, competitor gaps, customer needs
- **Threats:** Competitive moves, market shifts, risks

### Step 5: Prioritize Top 3 in Each Quadrant
Rank by:
- Impact (how much it matters)
- Certainty (how confident we are)
- Actionability (can we do something about it)

### Step 6: Map TOWS Strategies
Combine quadrants into strategic actions:
- **SO (Strengths + Opportunities):** Use strengths to capture opportunities
- **WO (Weaknesses + Opportunities):** Address weaknesses to capture opportunities
- **ST (Strengths + Threats):** Use strengths to mitigate threats
- **WT (Weaknesses + Threats):** Avoid worst-case scenarios

## Assumptions to Validate
- ⚠️ [Assumption needing verification]

## Review Schedule

- **Next review:** [Date]
- **Trigger for early review:** [What would prompt reassessment]

## Suggested Updates to Context Files
- [ ] Add new competitive threats to `competitors.md`
- [ ] Update known issues in `product.md`
```

## Framework Reference

**SWOT + TOWS Framework:**
- **SWOT:** Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, Threats — categorize factors
- **TOWS:** Strategic matrix combining quadrants into actionable strategies
  - SO: Maxi-Maxi (leverage and expand)
  - WO: Mini-Maxi (improve and pursue)
  - ST: Maxi-Mini (leverage and defend)
  - WT: Mini-Mini (avoid and exit)

## Tips for Best Results
1. **Keep context files updated** — I'll pull strengths, weaknesses, threats from your files
2. **Be specific with evidence** — "Good brand" is weak; "42 NPS, 85% unaided awareness" is strong
3. **Focus on top 3** — Long lists dilute focus; prioritize ruthlessly
4. **Make it actionable** — Every item should connect to a potential action
5. **Use TOWS** — The magic is in combining quadrants, not listing them

# Positioning Statement Generator

Creates positioning using April Dunford's Obviously Awesome framework.

## Output
Save to `strategy/outputs/positioning-[YYYY-MM-DD].md`

## When to Use This Skill
- New product launch
- Pivot or rebrand
- Sales enablement
- Homepage rewrite

## The Problem

Most positioning is vague ("we're the leading solution for...") or copied from competitors. Without clear positioning, marketing struggles, sales pitches vary, and the product feels generic.

## What You'll Need
- Understanding of your product/service
- Knowledge of your target customers
- Competitive landscape awareness

## What You'll Get

- Complete positioning statement
- Tagline options (3 variations)
- Elevator pitch (30 seconds)
- Competitive frame
- Supporting messaging elements

## Process

### Step 1: Check Your Context
First, read the user's context files:
- `context/product.md` — What does your product do? What's the current positioning?
- `context/personas.md` — Who are your target customers? What do they care about?
- `context/competitors.md` — What are the competitive alternatives?
- `context/company.md` — What's your strategic focus?

**Tell the user what you found.** For example:
> "I found your product positioning in product.md ('AI-powered project management for agencies') and 3 competitors with win/loss themes. I also have 2 personas (Jordan the PM, Alex the Owner). I'll use this as the foundation for positioning."

### Step 2: Identify Competitive Alternatives
What would customers do if your product didn't exist? Pull from competitors.md if available:
- Direct competitors
- Indirect alternatives (spreadsheets, manual processes)
- Status quo (doing nothing)

**If competitors.md is thin:**
> "I need to understand your competitive alternatives better. What do customers currently use to solve this problem?"

### Step 3: Define Unique Attributes
What do you have that alternatives lack? Pull from product.md:
- Features
- Capabilities
- Approach
- Focus

### Step 4: Map Attributes to Customer Value
Why do those attributes matter to customers? Connect to personas.md:
- Time saved
- Money saved
- Risk reduced
- Outcome improved

### Step 5: Identify Best-Fit Customers
Who cares most about this value? Reference personas.md:
- Characteristics
- Context
- Triggers that make them care

### Step 6: Determine Market Category
What category helps customers understand your value quickly?
- Existing category (new player)
- Subcategory (specialized version)
- New category (category creator)

### Step 7: Synthesize Positioning Statement
Combine all elements into a clear statement.

## Framework Reference

**April Dunford's Obviously Awesome (2019)**
- Positioning is not messaging — it's the strategic context that makes messaging clear
- Start with competitive alternatives, not features
- Best-fit customers validate positioning; don't try to be everything to everyone
- Market category is a shortcut to understanding

## Tips for Best Results
1. **Keep your context files updated** — I'll build positioning on your personas, product, and competitors
2. **Be specific about alternatives** — Generic competitors = generic positioning
3. **Test with best-fit customers** — If they don't get it, iterate
4. **One positioning, multiple messages** — Positioning is stable; messaging adapts

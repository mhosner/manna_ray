# Launch Checklist Generator

Generate comprehensive launch checklists customized to your feature tier.

## Output
Save to `specs/outputs/launch-checklist-[feature]-[YYYY-MM-DD].md`

## When to Use This Skill
- Any feature launch (big or small)
- Standardizing your launch process
- Making sure nothing falls through the cracks

## What You'll Need
- Feature description
- Launch tier (T1 = major, T2 = medium, T3 = minor)
- Target launch date

## Process

### Step 1: Check Your Context
First, read the user's context files:
- `context/product.md` — What feature is launching? What's the context?
- `context/company.md` — Team structure (who owns what?)
- `context/personas.md` — Who will this impact? How should we communicate?

**Tell the user what you found.** For example:
> "I found 'Resource Planning v2' in your product.md as a Q2 priority. Your team structure shows 12 in Customer Success and 15 in Sales. I'll include support and sales enablement in the checklist."

### Step 2: Gather Launch Details
If not clear from context, ask:
> "I need a few things to create the launch checklist:
> 1. What feature are you launching? (I found [X] in product.md — is that it?)
> 2. What's the target launch date?
> 3. What tier is this launch?"

**Tier Decision Guide:**
| Tier | Examples | Risk Level |
|------|----------|------------|
| T1 | New product, pricing change, major feature overhaul, >50% of users affected | High |
| T2 | New feature, significant UX change, integration launch | Medium |
| T3 | Bug fix, copy change, small enhancement, internal tool | Low |

**Do NOT generate a checklist with [placeholders]. Get the real info first.**

### Step 3: Determine Launch Tier
- **T1 (Major):** New product, major feature, pricing change
- **T2 (Medium):** Significant feature, affects many users
- **T3 (Minor):** Small improvement, bug fix, low risk

### Step 4: Generate Checklist
Checklist is customized by tier — T1 gets everything, T3 gets essentials.

### Step 5: Assign Owners
Every item needs an owner — use team structure from company.md when available.

### Step 6: Set Review Points
Pre-launch review, go/no-go, post-launch review.

```

## Framework Reference
**Tiered launch playbook**:
- Scope checklist to risk level
- Every item has an owner
- Rollback is planned in advance

## Tips for Best Results

1. **Keep context files updated** — I'll pull team structure and success metrics from your files
2. **Be honest about tier** — Under-scoping leads to missed steps
3. **Assign real owners** — "TBD" items don't get done
4. **Plan the rollback before you need it** — It's too late when things go wrong

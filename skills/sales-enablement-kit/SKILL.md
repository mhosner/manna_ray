# Sales Enablement Kit

Create complete sales enablement materials for new features or products.

## Output
Save to `launch/outputs/sales-kit-[YYYY-MM-DD].md`

## When to Use This Skill
- New feature launches
- New tier or pricing changes
- Entering new market segments
- Competitive response situations

## What You'll Need

**Critical inputs (ask if not provided):**
- What are you enabling sales on? (feature, product, pricing)
- Who's the target buyer?

**Nice-to-have inputs:**
- Value prop and key differentiators
- Competitive context
- Recent win/loss insights

## Process

### Step 1: Check Your Context
First, read the user's context files:
- `context/product.md` — Feature details, pricing, value prop
- `context/personas.md` — Target buyers, their pain points, language
- `context/competitors.md` — Competitive positioning, differentiation
- `context/company.md` — Sales motion, team structure

**Tell the user what you found.** For example:
> "I found 'Resource Planning' in your product.md as the feature to enable. Your Jordan persona (PM) is the buyer — they care about 'workload visibility.' Your competitors.md shows Monday.com is the main competitor. I'll build battlecards and objection handlers based on this."

### Step 2: Gather Enablement Context
If you don't have enough context, ask:
> "Before I create this sales enablement kit, I need:
> 1. What feature/product? (I found [X] in product.md)
> 2. Who's the target buyer? (I found [personas] in personas.md)
>
> I can pull competitive positioning from competitors.md and value props from product.md."

### Step 3: Identify Sales Context
- What's the sales motion? (PLG, sales-assisted, enterprise)
- What stage of deal? (Discovery, demo, negotiation)
- What objections are expected?

### Step 4: Build Core Materials
- One-pager for leave-behind/email
- Battlecard for competitive positioning
- ROI framework for value justification

### Step 5: Create Talk Tracks
- Discovery questions to qualify
- Objection handlers with responses
- Demo talking points

### Step 6: Provide Templates
- Outreach email templates
- Follow-up sequences
- Proposal language

## Output Template

```markdown

## 8. Internal Training Notes

### Key Messaging
- Lead with: "[Primary value prop]"
- Avoid: "[Common mistake or off-brand messaging]"
- Always mention: "[Proof point or differentiator]"

### Common Mistakes
- ❌ [Thing sales reps do wrong]
- ✅ [What to do instead]

### Escalation Triggers
- If prospect mentions [X], loop in [person/team]
- If deal size exceeds $[X], involve [person/team]
- If competitor is [X], use [specific battlecard]
```

## Framework Reference
**Sales enablement components:**
1. Educate (one-pager, training)
2. Differentiate (battlecards)
3. Qualify (discovery questions)
4. Handle (objection scripts)
5. Justify (ROI calculator)
6. Close (demo script, templates)

## Tips for Best Results
1. **Use your context files** — I'll pull personas, competitors, and value props automatically
2. **Know your buyer** — Different personas need different emphasis
3. **Be specific on competitors** — Generic battlecards don't help
4. **Test with sales** — Have AEs review and provide feedback
5. **Keep it scannable** — Sales will skim, make key points bold
6. **Update regularly** — Stale enablement is worse than none

## Suggested Updates
After creating the kit:
- [ ] Train sales team on new materials
- [ ] Update `competitors.md` with competitive insights from sales feedback
- [ ] Track win rates with new enablement
